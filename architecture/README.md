## System Overview

The Dell Port Tracer is a comprehensive web-based application that helps network administrators trace network connections and manage VLANs across Dell switches using SSH-based secure communication. The system consists of:

- **Web Application**: Flask-based Python application with advanced VLAN management capabilities and enhanced session timeout handling
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for storing switch configurations, trace history, and VLAN management audit logs
- **Authentication**: Windows Active Directory integration with role-based access control
- **Session Management**: Proactive session timeout warnings, cross-tab state management, and graceful session expiration handling
- **Infrastructure**: Docker containerized deployment with nginx reverse proxy
- **Network Integration**: SSH-based switch communication with comprehensive Dell switch model support
- **VLAN Manager**: Enterprise-grade VLAN configuration and port management system with workflow-based operations (onboarding/offboarding)
- **Security Framework**: Multi-layer input validation and command injection prevention
- **Professional UI**: Select2-powered dropdowns with intelligent styling, perfect text alignment, and cross-browser consistency
- **User Experience**: Real-time dynamic updates, contextual help text, and optimized search functionality
- **State Management**: Frontend UI state preservation system for sidebar navigation context during operations
- **Version Management**: Centralized version control system with single source of truth in `app/__init__.py` and programmatic access via `get_version.py` utility
